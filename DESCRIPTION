Description: 'QuantLib' bindings are provided for R using 'Rcpp' via an updated
 variant of the header-only 'Quantuccia' project (put together initially by Peter
 Caspers) offering an essential subset of 'QuantLib' (and now maintained separately
 for the calendaring subset). See the included file 'AUTHORS' for a full list of
 contributors to both 'QuantLib' and 'Quantuccia'. Note that this package provided
 an initial viability proof, current work is done (via approximately quarterly releases
 tracking 'QuantLib') in the smaller package 'qlcal' which is generally preferred.
